      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <h5>Gee's Calm Balm&trade; has been in business for over 50 years. All of our products are 100% certified organic. We partner with small local farms to make all of our boutique grade products. We donate 10% of our profits to each farm giving back to our community through our Super Farm&trade; program. The company was founded by Harry Gee in 1973. Harry has always been drawn to the natural and holistic way of living. Harry has dedicated his life to educating others on the benefits of natural products, and particularly, organic skin care and that's when Gee's Calm Balm was born.</h5>
      <br />
      <h5>Harry's journey began when he started to experience issues with his own skin. He was frustrated with the products that were available on the market, and how many of them were filled with chemicals and harmful ingredients. After doing some research, he discovered the world of organic skin care, and never looked back.</h5>
      <br />
      <h5>Organic skin care products are made from natural ingredients that are free from pesticides, chemicals, and synthetic additives. They work in harmony with the body's natural processes to nourish and heal the skin, without causing any harm or damage. These products are not only better for your health, but also for the environment, as they are made using sustainable and eco-friendly methods.</h5>
      <br />
      <h5>I started selling organic skin care products with the aim of providing people with an alternative to the harsh and toxic products that were dominating the market. My business has grown over the years, and I am proud to say that I have helped many people improve the health and appearance of their skin, while also supporting local and ethical businesses.</h5>
      <br />
      <h5>One of the things that sets our products apart is the care and attention that goes into their creation. We work closely with a team of experts who are passionate about using the highest quality organic ingredients to create products that are effective and safe for all skin types.</h5>
      <br />
      <h5>We believe that everyone should have access to healthy and natural skin care products, and that is why we are committed to making them affordable and accessible to everyone. We are constantly researching and developing new products that are innovative and effective, and we are excited to continue growing my business and helping people around the world.</h5>
      <br />
      <h5>Thank you for taking the time to learn about our journey, and we hope to have the opportunity to share our passion for organic skin care with you soon!</h5>
